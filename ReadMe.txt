Under the guidance of MoneyAI, I successfully completed two assignments focused on trading data analysis and strategy optimization.

Assignment 1 involved generating detailed Excel files containing trading insights, data summaries, and visualizations. The provided raw data was cleaned, analyzed, and structured into multiple Excel sheets, showcasing key findings such as profit/loss distributions, parameter correlations, and recommendations for strategy enhancement. These Excel files were created using Python-based data processing and visualization scripts.

Assignment 2 required analyzing Python files to generate advanced trading analysis reports. These scripts automated data cleaning, validation, profit/loss computation, and chart generation. The output Excel files include clear summaries, insightful visualizations, and actionable recommendations tailored to trading strategies.

Both assignments are bundled into a structured ZIP file, containing Python scripts, Excel reports, theoretical documentation, and a comprehensive README file with instructions for reproducibility. This package ensures all deliverables are well-organized and accessible for future reference.
